## Introduction

3GPP Release 17 brings Multicastâ€“Broadcast Services (MBS) to the 5G System, based on 5G Core and New Radio. MBS allows
the network to select the most suitable among point-to-multipoint (PTM) or point-to-point (PTP) delivery based on
requirements set by either service providers or network operators and/or taking into account concurrent user demand.

Additional information can be found at: https://5g-mag.github.io/Getting-Started/pages/5g-multicast-broadcast-services/

### About the implementation

This repository contains Docker Compose components to deploy several network functions related to MBS.
The detailed usage instructions are available at
the [Getting Started guides](https://5g-mag.github.io/Getting-Started/pages/5g-multicast-broadcast-services/tutorials/mbs-in-5gc.html).

> [!NOTE]
> Docker images are available for `amd64/x86-64` and `arm64` based systems.

Some of the components are unmodified Open5GS Network Functions, those are marked with the regular Network Function's
name and follow Open5GS' versioning, the latest version available is the `v2.7.2`.

| Network Function | image name          | version |
|------------------|---------------------|---------|
| AUSF             | ghcr.io/5g-mag/ausf | v2.7.2  |
| BSF              | ghcr.io/5g-mag/bsf  | v2.7.2  |
| NRF              | ghcr.io/5g-mag/nrf  | v2.7.2  |
| NSSF             | ghcr.io/5g-mag/nssf | v2.7.2  |
| PCF              | ghcr.io/5g-mag/pcf  | v2.7.2  |
| UDM              | ghcr.io/5g-mag/udm  | v2.7.2  |
| UDR              | ghcr.io/5g-mag/udr  | v2.7.2  |

The following components are being developed for MBS and the latest version available is the `0.1.2`.

| Network Function               | image name                    | version |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| AMF (with Rel-17 MBS features) | ghcr.io/5g-mag/amf_with_mbs   | 0.1.2   |
| SMF + MB-SMF                   | ghcr.io/5g-mag/smf_mb-smf     | 0.1.2   |
| UPF + MB-UPF                   | ghcr.io/5g-mag/upf_mb-upf     | 0.1.2   |
| Test MBS AF/AS                 | ghcr.io/5g-mag/test_mbs_af_as | 0.1.2   |
| gNB (with Rel-17 MBS features) | ghcr.io/5g-mag/gnb_with_mbs   | 0.1.2   |
| UE (with Rel-17 MBS features)  | ghcr.io/5g-mag/ue_with_mbs    | 0.1.2   |

Those components are being developed using [Open5GS](https://github.com/5G-MAG/open5gs) for the Network Functions AMF,
MB-SMF and MB-UPF, [rt-srsRAN_Project](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-srsRAN_Project) for the gNB
and [srsRAN_4G](https://github.com/5G-MAG/srsRAN_4G) for the UE, using the `5mbs` branch.

## Installing Dependencies

Follow the [steps for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and install the docker buildx and
docker compose plugins

## Downloading

The MBS Docker images can be obtained:

* From the 5G-MAG's GitHub Container Registry and pulled with Docker (`docker pull ghcr.io/NAMESPACE/IMAGE_NAME`). This
  step is not needed if you run Docker compose as per the [Running](#running) section below.
* The docker images can also be obtained by cloning the repository:

```bash
  cd ~
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-mbs-examples.git
```

## Building

You can skip this step if you decide to download the images rather than cloning the repository.

> [!NOTE]
> This method uses the `docker-bake.hcl` file and requires `docker-buildx-plugin`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When building the images, modify the `FIVEG_MAG_MBS_VERSION` and `OPEN5GS_VERSION` variables in the `.env` file to use
> a specific version.

From the top level directory of the repository run:

```bash
  cd rt-mbs-examples
  docker buildx bake
```

## Running

First modify the `.env` file. Change the `DOCKER_HOST_IP=<your_host_ip_address>` with your machine's IP address, like
this `DOCKER_HOST_IP=192.168.1.2`. This lets the UPF + MB-UPF use your machine's Internet connection to route the
traffic using NAT.

To run the Docker images, select either the internal deployment or the external deployment and from the top level
directory of the repository:

### Internal Deployment

```bash
# to use the internal deployment
docker compose -f compose-files/internal/docker-compose.yaml --env-file=.env up -d
```

```bash
# to tear down the internal deployment
docker compose -f compose-files/internal/docker-compose.yaml --env-file=.env down
```

### External Deployment

```bash
# to use the external deployment
docker compose -f compose-files/external/docker-compose.yaml --env-file=.env up -d
```

```bash
# to tear down the external deployment
docker compose -f compose-files/external/docker-compose.yaml --env-file=.env down
```
